Console app 1 

i have used dotnet cli to create a console app 
dotnet new console -n MyAppName

now use dotnet command to add new class inside project 
dotnet new class -n MyClassName

static methods cant be called from instance 
static method is kept on type level and not in object level ( type level means class def in python)
staic methods is useful if you dont need any object level data (ones you get during init)
it is simple and more optimized 

keywords for variable iinit 

readonly : a variable that cannot be changed after initlization can be created value in method 
const : a constant variable that cannot be changed but it needs value to be given during init of variable 
this : refers to instance when object is maded from given class

public : you can call this method from diffrent files in same namespace or assembly
private : you cant call from outside
